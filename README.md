# Calliope mini Demo (and Board Test)

Calliope mini Demo.

This repository contains the demo code and the board test code. The board test is only shown after initially 
flashing the device. Any subsequent reset or power cycle will not show it again.

## Compiling

- `yt build` (add `--config config_en.json` to compile with English localization, default is German)
- copy the `calliope-firmware-v3.1.0.hex` on the board


## Test Code 

After flashing this code, the test program will be executed once. Pressing `RESET` will directly go
into the demonstration code, as desribed in the next section.

- Triple beep
- LED matrix full on, dimming down, and back up
- check reading the accelerometer (final checkmark)
- RGB led colors (red, green, blue)
- If further testing is required the board can be tilted and turned to show:
    - `+` face up, `-` down
    - `L` tilted left, `R` right, `U` up, `D` down
    - `S` shaked, `2` 2G, `8` 8G, `F` free fall
    - `0`-`3`, `A`, `B`, `A+B` touch pins and buttons
- Pressing A, B or A+B will also light up the RGB led in different colors.    
- Blow on the microphone will light up the LED matrix.    
    
## Demonstration code

- An Intro is shown (may be skipped using long `A+B` click).
- Menu: 1-4
     - 1: Oracle (shows a smiley or sadly on button press)
     - 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Well
     - 3: Love Meter (touch P1 and P2 to show value, errata: it's P0 and P3 in the booklet)
     - 4: Snake (adaped snake code from the [microbit-samples](https://github.com/lancaster-university/microbit-samples/))

Clicking `A+B` should reset back to the menu selection.
